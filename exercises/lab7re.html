    <h1>Lab 7 - Expandable Blocks</h1>

    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
        <p>Welcome to Lab 7! This is an interactive exercise demonstrating jQuery and CSS toggling. Click "more" to expand this block and see the full content. This expandable feature is useful for creating collapsible sections on web pages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
        <p>This is the second nice block with different content. Learning web development requires practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These three technologies work together to create dynamic and interactive web experiences for users around the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
        <p>Third block here with even more interesting information! jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. It provides a concise syntax for selecting elements and performing operations, making it easier to create interactive features.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
        <p>Another expandable block to demonstrate the functionality. CSS classes can be toggled dynamically using jQuery to change the appearance and behavior of elements. This creates smooth transitions between different states without requiring page reloads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="nice-block"><span>more</span> 
        <p>The final block in our series of expandable content sections. Remember to test your code in different browsers to ensure compatibility. Web standards help ensure that your pages work consistently across different platforms and devices for all users.</p>
